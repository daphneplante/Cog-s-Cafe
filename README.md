# Cogs-Cafe
Cog's Cafe Live Site

This is the first website I have developed for my Web Design I class.

Skills featured here are HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

Cog's Cafe is not meant to represent a real company. I made up the design, logo, branding, entire idea
for the sole purpost of education, learning the skills needed for future branding and web development jobs.

If there is a company called Cog's Cafe, all rights to the name go to them.
